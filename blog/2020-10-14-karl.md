[KAR$^3$L](http://karl.qanta.org/) is a next-generation spaced repetition learning tool developed by the natural language processing lab at University of Maryland ([CLIP lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)). Unlike traditional methods where all flashcards are treated as equal and all users are treated as equal, KAR$^3$L reads the content of each flashcard and the study history of each individual user, then chooses a time to review the flashcard in order to mxaimizes the psychological spacing effect.

In this post, we summarize our first phase tests. By analyzing the study history of our users, we provide some insights into how KAR$^3$L works, its advantages over traditional methods, and where it can be improved. We'll also give a sneak peek of what's coming next.

We are happy to discuss this project. Joining our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PTfEmHd), or reach out to our team directly: [@ihsgnef](https://twitter.com/ihsgnef), [@matthewmshu](https://twitter.com/@matthewmshu), and [feet-thinking@googlegroups.com](feet-thinking@googlegroups.com).

## Where we are right now?
Since our [public launch](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&p=379140&sid=8ae602e914bc1e56736a07030176c718) on August 24th, 424 users signed up, and produced in total over 75,000 study records. Each study record consists of the user ID, flashcard ID, date of study, and whether the user answered correctly. The growth in number of users and records is shown below.

In addition to developing a new tool for studying, we also want to answer the scientific question of whether machine learning can improve spaced repetition. For this purpose, we implemented two traditional models: [Leitner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) and [SM-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo), and compare them against our model. Some users who signed up are randomly selected to these traditional methods as control groups. Below is a breakdown of how many users are assigned to each model, and how many records each group contributed.

## Overview of KAR$^3$L vs Leitner vs SM-2
Now we take a closer look at how our model performs. First, we want to get a basic understanding of what kind of flashcards are shown to the users. We categorize each study record by (1) its result, and (2) whether the user was studying a new flashcard or reviewing an old one. The figure belows shows a breakdown of study records in to these $2x2=4$ categories.

We start to see some difference between KAR$^3$L and other models. But are these differences good or bad? Is KAR$^3$ helping users make more progress?
